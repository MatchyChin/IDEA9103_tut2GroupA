## User Input - Interactive Color Blocks

Welcome to the Interactive Color Blocks experience! This dynamic visual display reacts to your mouse movement, creating a captivating dance of colors and shapes on your screen.

### Interactive Instructions

1. **Move your mouse** across the canvas to change the colors and sizes of the blocks. The position of your mouse cursor influences the hue and size of each block in real-time.

2. The **distance of the cursor** from the center of a block will adjust its size â€“ closer will increase the size and further away will decrease it.

3. The **angle of the cursor** in relation to each block's centre will affect the color, creating a gradient of macaroon-inspired hues that vary as you move.

The painting gives me the feeling of looking down on a traffic road, and my idea was to have the small squares represent the traffic and the large squares represent the buildings.
