<h1 id="IDEA9103-project">IDEA9103 Design Programming Creative Coding Major Project </h1>
<p>In this project, we have selected the artwork from Piet Mondrian 'Broadway Boogie Woogie'</p>
<p>We first recreate the artwork in p5.js coding with a touch of responsive change which the size of the artwork will change based on the window size. We then develop our creation in different approaches such as Audio, Time-Based, and User Input to create different animations.</p>

<p>This output shows the recreated artwork 'Broadway Boogie Woogie' by Piet Mondrain using p5.js from scratch.</p>
<p>The artwork we created has a responsive outcome where users can change the window size meanwhile the artwork is still in frame.</p>

<p>Preset audio has been implemented in this section where users can click on the screen to play and pause the music to see the animation effect.</p>
<p>When the music is played, the blocks will change sizes in response to the music's frequency meanwhile different colors of the blocks will act slightly different.</p>


<h2 id="timebase-method">Time-Based Animation </h2>

<p>The painting gives me the feeling of looking down on a traffic road, and my idea was to have the small squares represent the traffic and the large squares represent the buildings. </p>     


<h2 id="userinput-method">User Input Animation </h2>

<p>I have modernized Piet Mondrian's iconic "Broadway Boogie Woogie" by opting for vibrant macaron hues in place of the primary colors traditionally used.</p>
<p>The shift to these brighter, more vivid tones aims to infuse the artwork with a youthful and contemporary spirit.</p>  
<p>Through user interaction with the mouse, a novel visual experience unfolds, ingeniously blending classic art with current trends.</p>
